                    <p>Beef Asparagus</p>
                </div>
                <p>We are just starting to see spring asparagus in the markets these days, and I saw a really fresh selection today. In fact, the asparagus was so fresh that I 
                    decided to make a beef asparagus stir fry with some of our very valuable contraband USDA choice sirloin steak.We usually prefer to pan-sear those steaks with 
                    just a little salt (we did not carry them all the way over from our local NJ Costco for nothing. They are perfect on their own), but the second we tried this beef 
                    asparagus stir fry dish, we had no regrets! This beef asparagus stir fry recipe is one of those 15-minute, over-rice, easy-to-make, one-pan dishes with lots of nice sauce to 
                    soak into the rice. The fresh asparagus gives a fresh and unique favor with a texture similar to bamboo shoots.  You can also substitute chicken for the beef and make this dish into a 
                    chicken asparagus stir fry. Happy spring! Beef Asparagus stir fry is the perfect one-pan over rice quick and easy dinner!

                    <p>California Maki Sushi</p>
                </div>
                <p>California roll, a type of inside-out sushi roll (uramaki) in which vinegared rice (rather than nori, an edible seaweed) forms the outside of the roll, usually encompassing cucumber, 
                   crab (or imitation crab), and avocado.A California maki or roll is a traditional sushi roll made inside out. So instead of seaweed wrapped around the roll, it is wrapped in rice. 
                   California roll ingredients usually include cucumber,avocado, and crab meat or imitation crab. It's now a world-famous delicacy that most know as created in Japan.
                   The wasabi and soy sauce will give the hotness and mild saltiness of sushi. Some sushi,like California rolls, even have tropical fruits to give that sweet flavor. No matter how your sushi is made, 
                   you can expect a burst of different flavors in one mouthful.</p>
